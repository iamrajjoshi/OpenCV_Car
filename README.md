# OpenCV Car Project #

The goal of the project is to use OpenCV to enable a vehicle to autonomously navigate within a lane. OpenCV is used to detect the lane and determine a steering maneuver to stay in the lane. The maneuver is then executed by a custom API to interface to the Motorshield. 


## Parts: ##

* Raspberry Pi 3B+

* Raspberry Pi Camera v2

* Raspberry Pi Motor Shield
